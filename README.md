# TD-Express v0.2.1

**TD-Express** is a Test-driven Design app that allows designers to compare live or local websites to original mock-ups. TDD screenshots the website with a headless browser and compares the image to the designer's original specs. Discrepancies are detected down to the last byte, and any differences are highlighted in red.

Accurate. Fast. Reliable. Test-driven Design.

Built on the Express framework.
